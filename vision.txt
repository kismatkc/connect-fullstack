ddd


posts


we need to decide what data to feed to postData
defualt postData = []
scenarios
1.path matches route postData = yourData
2.path doesnot matches route postData = friendsData
3.path  matches root postData = friendsData
4.path not available postData = [] done






Like ={
  id: PK,UUID
  postid: refrence the posts table (fk),
  user: refences the user table (fk),
  created at: dat eith time stamp

}



like functionilty pseudocode
1.user clicks on the like button we create a Like row
2.user clicks on the like button again we delete the Like created earlier
3.using useeffect to track liked state and if user choses to  like use debouncing to cancel/commit like api call(5s)
4.After ~5s we commit the call

 scenarios and Edge cases 
 1.anything event under 5 sec is covered by useffect cleanup 
 2. if user choses to dislike after 5 sec it has to bypass a consion that acutal like was commited.So i will intruce a new state caleed likedCreated to track it.
 if like likeCreated is tru than only you cna delte it after deltion set the liked and likedSUcces state to false


like status
1.post component mounts it also fetchs the status of like and until we have it it wont render post at all.if status  is not determiend it passes as props.
2.how to determine the status?
check if any row with  postId and useriD exist
if yes then like state will be true 
if no then like state will be false.


likestatus controller
so it receves the userId and postId and it chekcs if such row exist.
if relation found it send 200 with data obejct(.single)
if no rleation ofund it sends 404 with error so in client side in catch block if any error then it will defualt that to false.




comments

structure
comment = {
id pk,
postId refrences posts tbale fk on delte cacade,
userId refrences users table fk on delte cacade,
description text,
createdAt timestampz
}

ui logics
1.we will use normal axios post request for creating comments.Upon succesful creation we will invalidte the query 
2.we will use useQuery for fetching commets for responsiveness.Fetch with most recent one on the top 

ui view
1.If 0 comments show 
No commets yet
creating comment box
2.if 1 comment show it only with no View more comments button
3.if more than 1 then oppen a sheet from right just below the post.
Sheet ui
it will have a crete ocmment logic in the bottom on the top it will shwo the ocmmend as well.


description ui 
1.description is guaranted

2.if description is > 70  append ... and a readmore button 


3.if desceiption is < 70 show the entire description.



Chat ui
1. On click to sheet button we will display a sheet from right sidecovering 80 percentage.
2. from the phone ss get an idea
3.so 


final pseudocode for chat
1.Nisha wants to chat with praman.She clicks the praman message button.we emitt he registerUser event in the back and we intitlaize the userId to the mappign sytem where it lcoates the socket id.
2.

message =     { message: string; senderId: string; receiverId: string }
message = message[]


data = [18,23,3,43,1,2,3,46,32]


online status ui and logic

ui
friendsTab
defulat will be grey dot on the right bottom corner 
if online a green dot 
indiviudal chat
defualt offline 
if online it switches to online 

logic
so on succesful rfgster we wil emit onlien eevtna dn on succesful logout we will emit offline evnt to the userid





logic to blend status witht he query 

1.request to /api/friends-status
2.the controller gets all the friends ids \







obejctive how to implement online and offline wiht reddis 

1.resiter user when session is created.Have a flag this on once the code is fired and upon called in same session it wont do that 


we will impelemtn hearbeat and on signout remove thing for rmeoving
